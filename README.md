Over the last decade, the growing complexity of software-intensive systems has led both industry and academy to investigate on the use of different development techniques in order to manage their many different aspects.
Indeed, current Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) call for modern engineering practices to tackle advances in productivity and quality in several domains such as automotive, health-care, aerospace, industrial control or automation.

In this this context, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is increasingly applied to larger and more complex systems. However, MDE principles and techniques still need to be further developed to 1) scale up for real-life industrial projects and 2) provide more benefits at runtime (i.e. both during and after system execution). 

The general use of models and model-based approaches has already been intensively investigated both at design time (e.g. for driving the development of complex systems) and at runtime (e.g. to support deployment, monitoring or adaptations).
However, the existing approaches remain mostly independent from each other: in fact, design and runtime levels are too often not sufficiently interconnected, if connected at all.
With the advent of DevOps and continuous development principles, the engineering of CPSs would largely benefit from a closer integration between the design and runtime dimension of systems.
For instance, studying correspondences between the system design and its actual runtime behaviour allows to better understand critical situations and eventually locate the origin of failures.
Many methods and tools have been proposed for logging system execution and performing measurements of related runtime properties.
Unfortunately, these approaches do not usually allow a relevant integration with design models (if there is some kind of integration at all).
This is a real issue since these models are the ones typically associated with system analysis and decision-making.

The aim of this workshop is to provide a venue where both researchers and practitioners on model-based engineering can meet, disseminate and exchange ideas around this important problem of Design-Runtime Interaction.
The objective is also to come up with related challenges, to identify key issues to be addressed by the community and explore potential solutions to them. 

# Goals

The aim of this workshop is to provide a venue where both researchers and practitioners on model-based engineering can meet, disseminate and exchange ideas around the topic of design--runtime interaction in continuous software development of complex systems. The aim of this event is to come up with related challenges, to identify key issues to be addressed by the community and to explore potential solutions to them. 
The objective is also to come up with an agenda that can drive the research activities on design and runtime interaction for the next years.
Possible topics include notably (among possibly others):

* Model-driven techniques, methods and tools supporting Continuous Systems Engineering, applicable to different design flows, development processes and principles (including DevOps and AIOps).
* Model-driven techniques, methods and tools allowing any traceability and/or interaction between design time and runtime (especially those resulting from heterogeneous engineering practices or from the use of AI techniques).
* Model-driven techniques, methods and tools for inferring design deviations and identifying affected elements over a large spectrum of runtime system configurations or conditions (e.g. using Machine Learning techniques).
* Model-driven techniques, methods and tools allowing to efficiently collect and then accurately represent different kinds of runtime information.
* Model-driven techniques allowing to practically integrate, possibly in different ways, any feedback collected at runtime into design level models.
* Integrated model-driven methods and techniques for runtime analysis and design input collection, e.g. based on runtime-level probes injection.
* V&V mechanisms for linking results of runtime analysis (e.g. from execution traces) with design models expressing system requirements (both functional and non-functional ones).
* (Industrial) Case studies, experience reports, literature reviews or visionary positions related to any of the previously mentioned topics.
